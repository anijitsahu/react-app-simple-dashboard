# react-app-simple-charts-app

A Simple Charts Application using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook and [Chart JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) for plotting charts.

This application uses [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and ES6 style and are
combined to get a single build for production purpose using [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

ES6 `module` creation along with `import /export` is used. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is used to _transpile_ all [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) code to vanilla JavaScript code. To install all the dependecies `npm` is used.

All the charts are drawn by a popular library named [Chart JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2). In version 2 it supports [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) components.

For UI creation [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) are used. [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the new feature of [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is used for layout creation purpose.

This is a _responsive web application_ for viewing in both Mobile and Desktop.
